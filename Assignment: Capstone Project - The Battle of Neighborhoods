Capstone Project - Battle of Neighbourhoods ( Part -1)
Introduction/Business Problem:
What is the impact of the Socio economic factors to Crime rates in different suburbs in London?

I have been a resident of London for the last 16 years. Over a period of time, I have been watching the socio economic changes happening in London and also observing the increasing crime rates in different suburbs in London. I undertake the opportunity to analyse how the fluctuation in socio economic factors affect the crime rates in different suburbs in London.

London is a densily populated city with 8.85 million people in 2018. It is an ever growing city and as per the Office for National Statistics (ONS)London could on average grow by some 117,000 pa to 9.37 mll in 2021. As expected, this has an impact on socio economic landscape with increasing pressure on Government to ingest funds to maintain the quality of life in London. With the confusions over the Brexit looming over the future of UK, and funding cuts affecting the Police, NHS and local government initiatives including the social care, it has become challenging for many boroughs to control the crime rates down.

There are 33 boroughs in London each of which have different characteristics and governance. They are categorised as inner boroughs and outer boroughs. This analysis is based on the socio economic changes occured in these 33 bouroughs in the last decade and its impact on the crime rates in those aeas.

The factors considered are as follows:

Population density and degree of urbanization

Housing

Affordability
Number of Homeless people
People on housing benefits
Poverty
Number of People of Benefits
Number of people below poverty line
Social Care
School Funding
Parks
Recreational facilities
Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness.
Lone families
Unempleyment
Number of unemployed people
Number of people not employable
Effective strength of law enforcement agencies.
Reduction in Police Community Support Officers (PCSO)
Education
Performance of the schools
Dropouts
People are not pursuing to further education after school
NHS (National Health Service) - Medical facilities and the financial challenges
Average waiting time
Operations cancelled
Youth service budget cuts and closures
Number of units closed
Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration.
Counts on the different ethinicity of the population
Stability of the population with respect to residents’ mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors.
Modes of transportation and highway system.
Connectivity to railways and highwayes
Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics.
Number of recreational facilities
Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement.
Citizens’ attitudes toward crime.
Crime reporting practices of the citizenry
